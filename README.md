# coded-js-quiz

This is a project incorporating javascript in order to create a timed quiz. Players will answer the multiple choice questions - if correct, points will be added to their score; if incorrect, time will be deducted from the countdown. When the timer expires, players will be able to save their scores in local storage so that they may see them at a later time. 

Acceptance Criteria is below.
